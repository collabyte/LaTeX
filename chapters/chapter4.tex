LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents and technical note-taking in many fields, owing partially to its support for complex mathematical notation.\cite{wikipedia}

It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Arabic and Greek.\cite{wikipedia3}

LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.\cite{wikipedia2}
